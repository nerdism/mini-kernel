## mini kernel

<p>
a university project about a simple kernel written from scratch. currently the project is on the first stages of develoment and in this stages we dont have intention to make kernel that is usable for production environment it is just for learning and in the future we might think about a real kernel with a good and creative architecture.
</p>
<p>
we only have tested this kernel on the bochs emulator so if you want to try it. first install the bochs.
for running the kernel, clone the project and then

</p>

```
$ make
$ bochs
```

<p>
if you are intersted in reading this kernel code but you don't have exprience or don't know where to begin but you know c and some assembly for x86 machine and operating system concepts you can find all you need in documents folder begin with os-dev pdf we ourselfs began from there after reading that I'm sure you will figure out how to begin reading our code and also the code structure, we are trying to make good documentation for this kernel and specially documentation for  drivers we wrote with the help of the books and other projcts mentioned.
this kernel is written by two tremendously motivational iranian computer students.
(at the time of writing this readme i think i drank to much coffie :D )

[Basekernel](https://github.com/dthain/basekernel/wiki) project also gave us a lot of help .
